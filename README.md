## Muon Chemistry and Kinetics in Deuterium
This is a documentation of the solution of the coupled differential equations of the muon chemistry that goes on in the muon capture in deuterium. 
When a negative muon enters pure deuterium gas, it loses its kinetic energy in subse- quent collisions with the molecules of the gas. The initial kinetic 
energy of the muon beam ranges from 5 - 20 MeV such that it is enough to penetrate the target and slow down to attain energies of the range of 10-20 eV
(this is well within the range of the ionization potential of deuterium). This energy range is suitable for the muon to undergo atomic capture in deuterium. The figure below shows the complicated kinetics of the muon capture and all its states:</br>

The populations of the doublet (n1/2) and quartet (n3/2) states of the the Î¼d atom can be found by solving the sets of coupled differential equations given below:</br>

The symbols in the above equation are the variuos rates of respective decays and reactions as depicted in the figure above.</br></br>
This repository documents the detailed description in derivations of these equations in kinetic_sol.pdf. I used **Mathematica** to find the 
**anaytical solution** of these **coupled differential equations**. This is shown in the notebook (saved as pdf) finalSol.
